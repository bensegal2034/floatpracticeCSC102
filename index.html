                The caracal (Caracal caracal) /ˈkærəkæl/ is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and arid areas of Pakistan and northwestern India. It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long canine teeth. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches 40–50 cm (16–20 in) at the shoulder and weighs 8–19 kg (18–42 lb). It was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised.

                The caracal is a slender, moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build, a short face, long canine teeth, tufted ears, and long legs. It reaches nearly 40–50 cm (16–20 in) at the shoulder. The tan, bushy tail extends to the hocks.[19][20] The caracal is sexually dimorphic; the females are smaller than the males in most bodily parameters.

                The prominent facial features include the 4.5-cm-long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the forehead to the nose, the black outline of the mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid, probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun's glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings.[21] The fur, soft, short, and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs (the basal layer of hair covering the coat) are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs (the hair extending above the ground hairs) can be up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long in winter, but shorten to 2 cm (0.8 in) in summer.[22] These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November.[23] The hind legs are longer than the forelegs, so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.

                The caracal is typically nocturnal (active at night), though some activity may be observed during the day as well. However, the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed.[23] A study in South Africa showed that caracals are most active when the air temperature drops below 20 °C (68 °F); activity typically ceases at higher temperatures.[38] Claw scratching is prominent, and dung middens are typically not formed.[22] In Israel, males are found to have territories averaging 220 km2 (85 sq mi), while that of females averaged 57 km2 (22 sq mi). The male territories vary from 270–1,116 km2 (104–431 sq mi) in Saudi Arabia. In Mountain Zebra National Park, the home ranges of females vary between 4.0 and 6.5 km2 (1.5 and 2.5 sq mi). These territories overlap extensively.[21] The conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve as a method of visual communication; caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the head from side to side so that the tufts flicker rapidly. Like other cats, the caracal meows, growls, hisses, spits, and purrs.[20]

                A carnivore, the caracal typically preys upon small mammals, birds, and rodents. Studies in South Africa have reported that it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hares, and birds.[39][40][41] A study in western India showed that rodents comprise a significant portion of the diet.[35] They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one.[42] Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites.[43] Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck, and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80% of the diet.[22] Lizards, snakes, and insects are infrequently eaten.[1] In South Africa, caracals have been documented preying on small livestock in areas where sheep and goat are farmed. Livestock is however only a small and seasonal portion of their diet when wild prey is scarce.[39][24]

                Its speed and agility make it an efficient hunter, able to take down prey two to three times its size.[1] The powerful hind legs allow it to leap more than 3 m (10 ft) in the air to catch birds on the wing.[21][44][45] It can even twist and change its direction mid-air.[21] It is an adroit climber.[21] It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m (16 ft), following which it can launch into a sprint. While large prey such as antelopes are suffocated by a throat bite, smaller prey are killed by a bite on the back of the neck.[21] Kills are consumed immediately, and less commonly dragged to cover. It returns to large kills if undisturbed.[22] It has been observed to begin feeding on antelope kills at the hind parts.[23] It may scavenge at times, though this has not been frequently observed.[39] It often has to compete with foxes, wolves, leopards, and hyaena for prey.[26]

                Big Floppa, or simply Floppa, is an internet meme based around a caracal cat named Gosha (Russian: Гоша). Gosha was born on December 21, 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine.[1] In April 2018, he was adopted by Andrey Bondarev and Elena Bondareva from Moscow.[1][2] Andrey and Elena also own a housecat named Justin, who is 4 years older than Gosha and shares a room with him. Gosha enjoys eating shrimp and is very active around his apartment.

                Gosha's owner, Elena Bondareva, had created an Instagram account dedicated to Gosha and posted several images of him around the house. On December 24, 2019 Gosha's owner Andrey posted an Instagram photo showing the caracal lying on a windowsill with their domestic cat Justin.[3] This picture became the basis for the various Big Floppa memes. In late December 2019, ironic Instagram accounts referred to Gosha as "sahnr" or "big sahnr" after the instagram account of the same name.[3] In January 2020, an Instagram user young.taxi called him "Big Floppa".[4] In February, user tfosing posted a demotivator meme consisting of an image of Gosha with his ears digitally removed, captioned "Flop Exclusive," the earliest meme to use the picture of him on the windowsill. In May 2020, Big Floppa memes began to appear on Twitter and Reddit.

                Floppa is often compared with rappers because "Big Floppa" is very similar to rappers' scene names, with "Big Floppa" itself being a reference to the 1994 Notorious B.I.G song Big Poppa. He is also known for being a main character in memes about war crimes.[6] Also, Gosha is not the only "Floppa" in memes, the character called "Floppa" can be other caracals (such as Adolf, Kimbo, or Pumba)[citation needed], other wild cats, such as the cougar "Plinka" and the serval "Sogga".[3], or other animals in general such as the sphinx "Bingus". In particular, Bingus is usually portrayed as an enemy to floppa, with many in the floppa community portraying him in a negative way. Every fifth Friday of every year, Instagram Floppa fan-accounts celebrate "Floppa Friday". Floppa's meow is also something that is mentioned a lot, written as "Kerr" or "Karr" due to how it sounds and how his owner says it. Other memes of Floppa involves him eating cement and cardboard.[7]
